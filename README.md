# 2024_GameDevelopment : 2D Pygame Baseball Game Projects

This repository contains two simple Pygame based projects developed during the Game Programming Introduction course in the second semester of sophomore year.

- **Project 2** is a simple baseball batting simulation game built using Pygame.
- **Project 3** is a baseball batting game engine which is an improved version of Project 2's core system by applying mathematics and physics to achieve more realistic batting results.

Both are very simple projects, but they include key concepts in mathematics, physics, and game development learned throughout the course.
